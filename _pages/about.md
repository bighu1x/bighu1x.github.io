Hi! I’m ZX, a Student at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, Welcome to my homepage. 

In terms of my academic background, I graduated from Dongbei University of Finance and Economics majoring in Finance. During my undergraduate years, I laid a solid foundation in relevant fields through a series of courses. I actively participated in various academic activities, such as seminars and group projects, which not only deepened my understanding of the subject but also cultivated my teamwork and communication skills.

I believe that the postgraduate stage is a crucial period for me to further improve my professional ability and make contributions to my field. I'm looking forward to learning from my professors and classmates, and I'm determined to work hard to achieve better results in my research and study.​
